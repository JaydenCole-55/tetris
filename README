Hello, enjoy my tetris game.

First, I would like to acknowledge that I started from the sample 3 - javascript
rotation code as presented in the tutorial by the TA. The code written for that 
example is the work of those authors (The TA and whoever else worked on it). It
was said on Piazza that this is permitted but I would like to mention that.

The game completes steps a) though c) of the assignment fully.
Tiles fall down, stack up, and there are key interactions. For d),
    - Rows can be filled and will be removed
    - The game terminates when a tile piece cannot be fit into the screen. 
    - 'r' restarts the game 
    - 'q' does nothing
    - Right and left and up arrow keys do not affect the downward movement of the tile. 
    - The down key doubles the speed of the game.

Bonus:
    - Score incremented and shown to user for each row cleared
    - Pressing 'p' pauses the game
    - Visual cue that the game is over

Note: the canvas I made was a bit big for my surface pro screen. I would recommend
putting it on a monitor to test. That worked for me with the bigger screen size.
